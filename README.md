# MNIST-Digits

My first step into ML!

This is the classic example of recognizing handwritten digits provided
by the lovely folks behind the [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).

All the code is written in Python. To run, you will need

``pip install python-mnist``

and then

``python3 main.py`` or ``python main.py``

This has been made possible by Grant Sanderson and his [neural network videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk),
who continues to inspire me to explore the rich world of computer science and mathematics. <strong> THANK YOU! </strong>
